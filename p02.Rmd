title: "Portfolio Project 2 - "

> My goal in this project is to attempt to do (at least some of) the things that I did using SPSS prior to completing Portfolio Project 1. This includes...

### "Before and After" Datasets
See below, first, the "before" dataset (named wide_data). It has 100 observations (participants) with scores on 29 variables. The names of many of those variables index the kind of attitude that was measured (prejudicial, discriminatory, or stereotypes), when it was measured (pretest or posttest), and who was the target of the attitude (Democrats or Republicans). Then, see the "after" dataset (named long_data). It has 400 observations on only 7 variables. I achieved this in SPSS, but in this project I'm going to try to do it in R.
```{r laod packages and import data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
long_data <- read_sav("data/LongData copy.sav")
wide_data <- read_sav("data/V.3 CLEANED DATA copy.sav")
wide_data
long_data
